            Avery Bow is a Canadian fashion brand that began as a daydream, with a tribute to health and a 

passion for pockets! 

Founder Avery Luchia, who holds a BSc in Psychology, understands that the fashion industry is 

a multidisciplinary field which impacts health at many levels.

        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p>
            Avery Bow’s vision has always been to make it easy and exciting for medical professionals to 

buy better products in regards to both the design as well as environmental and ethical aspects 

of the production.  And while the playful aesthetics may speak directly to the wearer, the quality 

of the products is equally important.  An Avery Bow garment is not only fun to wear, or just look 

at, but is also produced in a way that strives to be sensitive to the environment and the people 

behind it.

        <h1>History & Heritage:</h1>
        <p>
            Avery Luchia is a recent graduate from the University of Lethbridge, with a BSc in Psychology. 

In 2008, while in high school, she volunteered at the Hawkesbury General Hospital in Ontario.  

This experience undoubtedly played an important part in Avery’s decision to pursue designing 

scrubs. 

In 2013 she moved to Banff, where she was inspired by its beauty to pick up a paintbrush for 

the first time. 

In 2015 she returned to sell tourist sweatshirts inspired by both Banff and topics related to 

health.

        <h1>Our Values:</h1>
        <p>
            At Avery Bow, we take health very seriously.  We understand that the fashion industry is second 

only to the energy industry as the top generator of pollution in the world today.

When Avery Bow was started, the aim was to create a fashion product that would move the 

people involved with the brand towards health. 

This is accomplished in multiple ways. 

Since the largest determinant of health is income, our garments are, and always will be, made in 

Canada. 

Currently our line is made from either vintage fabric or cotton fabric made in Canada.

Future plans include moving away from cotton to a more sustainable material, such as hemp or 

linen.

        <h1>The 2016 Collection:</h1>
        <p>
            At Avery Bow, blue is the new black.  Like the waves and tides in the ocean, Avery Bow knows 

trends come and go. However, the calming effect of the colour blue has is here to stay! 

Naturally, our favorite shade of blue is that of the Bow River in Banff! 

And why bow ties, you may ask?  They are far more practical and hygienic than neckties.  Plus 

they’re so cute.... EVERYONE looks good in a bow tie!  And, they use less material, making 

them even more sustainable! 

Avery Bow’s debut medical scrub line is constructed from vintage fabric that we are diverting 

from the landfill, making the collection truly sustainable. This exclusive fabric was used to make 

the Sun of a Beach men’s fashion line that was sold at Hudson’s Bay back in 1985.
